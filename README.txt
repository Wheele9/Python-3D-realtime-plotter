Hi Sathwik!

To start the 3-d plotting connect your arduino to the PC first.
After that you can start the program by opening a command prompt in the src folder(Shift+right click and select Open command window here). Type:
python main.v_01

A window will pop up, where You can fill the settings, Click on Read Data, and if your settings are ok, then a new button wil show up. Click that and the 3D plotting start right away.
